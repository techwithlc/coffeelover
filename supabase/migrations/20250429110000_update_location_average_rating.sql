-- Migration: Compute and maintain average coffee rating per location

-- Function to update the average rating inside the `locations` table whenever
-- the `location_ratings` table is mutated. At the moment we take the arithmetic
-- mean **only of the `coffee_rating` column** â€“ feel free to adapt the formula
-- later if you would like to combine the Wi-Fi / staff scores as well.
